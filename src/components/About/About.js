            <h5>About Us</h5>
            <p>
              There are countless online education marketplaces on the internet.
              And there’s us. We are not the biggest. We are not the cheapest.
              But we are the fastest growing. We have the highest course
              completion rate in the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the reason is, we don’t give up. When a student commits to a
              course, we commit to the student. We are not going to sugar coat
              it - we will make you complete, come what may. You may not have
              given much thought to what you are signing up for, but we believe
              you are signing up for knowledge that is useful and complete. We
              are ridiculously committed to our students. Be it constant
              reminders, relentless masters or 24 x 7 online support - we will
              absolutely make sure that you run out of excuses to not complete
              the course.
